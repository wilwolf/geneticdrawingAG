About

__GeneticLeonardo is a program that "evolves" drawings__. The chromosomes encode the position, shape and color of 50 polygons. The fittest chromosomes are those who produce images most like a given image.

The goal is to approximate any image with only 50 polygons.

Here's how it works:

1.  Generate a random population of chromosomes

2.  Produce images by interpreting these chromosomes

3.  Select the chromosomes that produce the best images

4.  Mate the best chromosomes by exchanging information

5.  Mutate the new chromosomes slightly

6.  Kill the worst ranked chromosomes

7.  Repeat from step 2 until satisfied

The most important classes are:

* [gd.gui.EvolutionRunnable](http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/master/src/gd/gui/EvolutionRunnable.java): Class in charge of actually running the evolution process.

* [gd.core.GAConfiguration](http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/master/src/gd/core/GAConfiguration.java): Encapsulates the settings of the genetic algorithm.

* [gd.core.GAInitialChromosomeFactory](http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/master/src/gd/core/GAInitialChromosomeFactory.java): Creates a suitable initial chromosome.

* [gd.core.GAPhenotypeExpresser](http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/master/src/gd/core/GAPhenotypeExpresser.java): Class that can interpret the information encoded in the chromosomes.

* [gd.core.LMSFitnessFunction](http://github.com/ynd/genetic-drawing/tree/master/src/gd/core/LMSFitnessFunction.java): Computes the fitness of a program as the Least-Mean-Sqare distance between the image it generates and the target image.
